# Description

This result is part of the project Data Rural Hub, developed in the Challenge Hub Program 2021 at the [Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity -CRI- ](https://cri-paris.org/en).
The aim of this study is to explore the digital solutions transforming the food systems towards sustainability, and develop a tool â€“DataRuraHub- to share the results to support the decision making in the digital transformation of the food systems. 


# Data-driven Solutions Transforming the Food Systems
Explore Data-Driven Agri-Food Solutions with Interactive Dashboards

:chart_with_upwards_trend: A total of 67 data-driven innovations were selected, which were narrowed down to those with relevant actions in the transformation of the food systems.

Use of open data sources, data analysis and  web deployment to give the user the ability to interact with the data.
